# Sande10Tweaker
## This is my personal tweaker for tweaking out unnecessary stuff from Windows without breaking any functionality.

For starters, use **Reccomended** stuff _first_(.bat, .ps1 and .reg) as they're not going to interfere or break your system, so, bare minimum of what you should disable. Next, use stuff manually. I hope the names are clear enough.

*Will constantly update with new stuff. Some tweaks are based on [Win10Tweaker(not reccomended to use anymore)](https://win10tweaker.ru/) options as they give them out in the wikinarium, [Winaero Tweaker](https://winaero.com/winaero-tweaker/) and [Ultimate Windows Tweaker 4](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/ultimate-windows-tweaker-4-windows-10). UI version coming someday.

# Explanations of what the files disable.
## **TO REVERT EVERYTHING TO INITIAL STATE, MAKE A BACKUP FOR REGISTRY. I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU USING UNSAFE TWEAKS, YOU TAKE THE RISK YOURSELF.**

**Disable all kinds of corporative tools** - Disables all corporative tools supplied with Windows. Not reccomended to use at actual corporates. Fine to use with home PC's as long as you know alternatives such as TeamViewer. Not known if it breaks updates or not.

**Disable Cortana and speech module updates** - Basically, if you don't use Cortana(at all) nor speech tools, disable both. Unlike most implementations of disabling it, this one doesn't break Search and any other services.

**Disable experimentation** - Microsoft can experiment on your pc's, very rarily, but can. I don't know if it influences updates, but if you want to keep the updates or you're literally using insider builds, better to not use this.

**Disable handwriting telemetry** - If you're not using handwriting, just disable the telemetry aswell.

**Disable hidden system monitoring** - System is monitored for interesting files on your PC. You can disable it, however, there's a slight chance of it breaking Windows Updates.

**Disable HyperV** - If you're using VMWare, VirtualBox or any other kinds of virtual machines, you probably don't need it. Pretty sure it can break some programs, but I'm not completely sure.

**Disable location** - You can disable Microsoft knowing your location, however, that can break several services related to Microsoft Store, Xbox, Updates and other online Microsoft services.

**Disable logging and feedback** - You ever found the "looking for a solution..." messages useful? Me neither. Disable them and free some resources.

**Disable memory diagnostics** - If your ram breaks you probably don't need it, but I dunno.

**Disable NFC** - If your device doesn't have NFC chips, just disable NFC services aswell.

**Disable virtual smart cards** - The name rings of any bell? If it doesn't, you probably don't need it. (basically it's some sort of physical keys to access your pc? or something?)

**Disable tablet, phone and kiosk modes** - Are you using a desktop or a laptop? Great, you're not using a tablet or a phone then. Also, you're probably not in a store either. If that's true, you don't need either of those modes. *not aware if it breaks updates, but I think it does.
