For starters, use **Reccomended** stuff _first_(.bat, .ps1 and .reg) as they're not going to interfere or break your system, so, bare minimum of what you should disable. 

**Disable Cortana and speech module updates** - Basically, if you don't use Cortana(at all) nor speech tools, disable both.

**Disable handwriting telemetry** - If you're not using handwriting, just disable the telemetry as well.

**Disable hidden system monitoring** - System is monitored for interesting files on your PC. You can disable it, however, there's a slight chance of it breaking Windows Updates.

**Disable HyperV** - If you're using VMWare, VirtualBox or any other kinds of virtual machines, you probably don't need it. 

**Disable location** - You can disable Microsoft knowing your location, however, that can break several services related to Microsoft Store, Xbox, Updates and other online Microsoft services.

**Disable logging and feedback** - Disables the "looking for a solution..." messages.

**Disable NFC** - If your device doesn't have NFC chips, just disable NFC services as well.
