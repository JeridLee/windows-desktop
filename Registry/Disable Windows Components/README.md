# Sande10Tweaker
## This is my personal tweaker for tweaking out unnecessary stuff from Windows without breaking any functionality.

For starters, use **Reccomended** stuff _first_(.bat, .ps1 and .reg) as they're not going to interfere or break your system, so, bare minimum of what you should disable. Next, use stuff manually. I hope the names are clear enough.

# Explanations of what the files disable.
## **TO REVERT EVERYTHING TO INITIAL STATE, MAKE A BACKUP FOR REGISTRY. I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU USING UNSAFE TWEAKS, YOU TAKE THE RISK YOURSELF.**

**Disable Cortana and speech module updates** - Basically, if you don't use Cortana(at all) nor speech tools, disable both. Unlike most implementations of disabling it, this one doesn't break Search and any other services.

**Disable experimentation** - Microsoft can experiment on your pc's, very rarily, but can. I don't know if it influences updates, but if you want to keep the updates or you're literally using insider builds, better to not use this.

**Disable handwriting telemetry** - If you're not using handwriting, just disable the telemetry aswell.

**Disable hidden system monitoring** - System is monitored for interesting files on your PC. You can disable it, however, there's a slight chance of it breaking Windows Updates.

**Disable HyperV** - If you're using VMWare, VirtualBox or any other kinds of virtual machines, you probably don't need it. Pretty sure it can break some programs, but I'm not completely sure.

**Disable location** - You can disable Microsoft knowing your location, however, that can break several services related to Microsoft Store, Xbox, Updates and other online Microsoft services.

**Disable logging and feedback** - You ever found the "looking for a solution..." messages useful? Me neither. Disable them and free some resources.

**Disable memory diagnostics** - If your ram breaks you probably don't need it, but I dunno.

**Disable NFC** - If your device doesn't have NFC chips, just disable NFC services aswell.

**Disable virtual smart cards** - The name rings of any bell? If it doesn't, you probably don't need it. (basically it's some sort of physical keys to access your pc? or something?)

**Disable tablet, phone and kiosk modes** - Are you using a desktop or a laptop? Great, you're not using a tablet or a phone then. Also, you're probably not in a store either. If that's true, you don't need either of those modes. *not aware if it breaks updates, but I think it does.
